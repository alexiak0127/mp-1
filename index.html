            <p>
                My name is <strong>Alexia Kim</strong>. I'm a senior at Boston University double majoring in Computer Science and Business Administration, with a concentration in Information Systems. 
                I'm passionate about building technology that is impactful and customer-centric, combining thoughtful design with practical outcomes to solve real problems.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I’ve developed full-stack web apps using Next.js, Firebase, and TypeScript, and built mobile features in Flutter for personalized and social experiences. I also work across open-source tools and cloud platforms like Vercel, Git, and Docker to deploy fast, modular products.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                On the strategy side, I’ve supported go-to-market planning, pricing, and product positioning as a Marketing TA and Core Challenge winner. I thrive in cross-functional environments where design, data, and business thinking come together.
